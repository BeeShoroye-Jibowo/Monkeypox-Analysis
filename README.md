# Monkeypox-Analysis
I analysed a monkeypox dataset using Google Sheets to gain key insights into how the world is testing for the virus and preventing the spread and deaths from the viral outbreak. 

In this project I cleaned, analysed and transformed data while also making use of Pivot tables. I concluded this project by creating a dashboard to visualise my findings.
